        <h2>What is a computer programmer?</h2>
        A computer programmer is a skilled professional who writes, tests,
        debugs, and maintains the detailed instructions, called code, that
        computers follow to perform specific tasks or functions. Programmers
        work with programming languages to create software, applications,
        websites, and other digital products. They are responsible for
        translating the requirements of a project into code that a computer can
        execute. Programmers also collaborate with software developers,
        designers, and other team members to create and improve technology
        solutions. Overall, computer programmers play a crucial role in the
        development and advancement of technology.
